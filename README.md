# Sampling Optimization
### An end-to-end approach for measurement sampling

This repository includes PyTorch models and data collection infrastructure to optimize interoperable modules for spatial inferences, timeseries predictions, and strategic sampling.

File structure:
- `modules`: Code stencils and implementations for the individual task modules.
- `data`: Scripts to simulate large datasets for baseline module training.
- `docs`: Documentation, informative examples, and graphics.
